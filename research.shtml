	  <h2>Augmented Reality</h2>
	  
	  <p><strong>Augmented Reality, robots and manufacturing:</strong> This PhD project in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.amrc.co.uk/facilities/factory-2050">AMRC</a>
        began in Feb 2019. Initial work is investigating the use of AR in relation to robots, safety and manufacturing.</p>
	<p><strong>Experiencing Arbor Low using AR:</strong> <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/arbor-low-stone-circle-and-gib-hill-barrow/">Arbor
          Low</a> is one of only two Neolithic enclosures in the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_District">Peak District</a>. It is a nationally-protected
        archaeological site and one of the most visited archaeological monuments in the Peak District. The enclosure
        contains a stone circle with 50 white limestone slabs, all now fallen. The aim of this TUoS-funded <a
          href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/sure/301">SURE</a> project is to use AR so that the stones can be viewed
        standing and interacted with in situ.</p>

      <h2>Computer facial modelling and animation</h2>
      <figure class="left"><img src="images/matt_leach_mouth_200x108.jpg"></figure>
      <p>I have worked on different aspects of facial modelling and animation for the last 30 years (see <a
          href="publications.shtml">Publications</a>). I am currently supervising two <a href="phdstudents.shtml">PhD
          students</a> in this area. Matt Leach is investigating lip stickiness in relation to a physically-based model
        of the mouth and Rabab Algadhy is investigating 3D mouth animation from 2D video.</p>

      <h2>Agent-based simulation</h2>
      <p>This work is a collaboration with my colleague <a href="https://paulrichmond.shef.ac.uk">Dr Paul Richmond</a>,
        who leads the work on simulation in the research group. We jointly supervise two <a
          href="phdstudents.shtml">PhD students</a> on simulation projects using agent-based modelling and
        GPUs for transport and pedestrain simulations. Our work on transport simulation and GPUs is also funded by
        Atkins (see <a href="funding.shtml">Funding</a>).</p>

      <h2>Sketch-based interfaces for large-scale pedestrian simulations</h2>
      <figure class="left"><img src="images/nmBFAcopy_200x149.jpg"></figure>
      <p>I have a long-standing interest in the use of sketching in computer graphics. Previous work has looked at
        sketch-based interfaces for creating models of the human face, as well as work in controlling crowd simulations.
        The current work is investigating real-time control of large-scale pedestrian simulations using a sketch-based
        interface (see <a href="phdstudents.shtml">PhD students</a>).</p>
